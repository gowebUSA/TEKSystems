## Goals
- Have a ready-made Dashboard for Executive Leadership use that is dynamic.
- Updated supply information with the most current/updated data for making a better decision on planning and scheduling.
- Usable information on Dashboard without the noise of other data.
- [ ] Need metrics requirements from LT Clancy and Scott (KPIs)

## Background and strategic fit
- The Training Unit just changed their training scheme from a Division like style to Team style training.
  - See User interaction and design / III. Team Structure below.
- ‚Å†This will reduce the manpower for making training schedule with the updated information from its sources/inventory.
  - Supply, gear, gadgets
  - Individual student's stats and availability
  - Individual instructor's stats and availability
- This centralized data collection from a variety of decentralized data that each department are using.


## Assumptions
- Field User will primarily access this using a Toughbook in the field with no internet access.
  - Data will be stored in an Excel file while in the field.
  - Then, will upload the data once the user gets internet connection.
- May use a CUI portal with no SSN for students and instructors' information. Supply data may be on a public view.
  
üí° We may use the FDR Contract App for this project.
